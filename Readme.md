# ValPlanAlyzer

A simple tool to upload your Valheim PlanBuild blueprint files to analyze what resources are needed to complete them.

## Usage

Visit the [Valheim Planalyzer](https://dsthedev.github.io/ValPlanAlyzer/) page, upload your blueprint file and press the Process Blueprint button. It will analyze the file and output a list of every resource needed to build it, as well as a full count so you can start gathering!

## Contribution

I'm working on rewriting this as a more modular react app, until then contributions are closed. But the plan is to keep this tool open and have bug reporting and potentially merge requests if people want to contribute!

## Buy me a Coffee?

I plan on adding a way to make donations, but I need to make sure it's secure. If you like this tool, please consider donating once I have this feature added.
